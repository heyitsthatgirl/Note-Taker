# Note Taker

## Description
Note Taker is an application that can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back end that saves and retrieves notes from a JSON file. 

## Usage

When the user first visits the Note Taker application, they will be presented with a button that says "get started." When this button is clicked it will take the user to a page containing all of their saved notes (if they exist). From there, the user has an option to view the saved notes by clicking on them, creating a new note, or deleting an existing note by clicking on the trash can icon.
